  about: |
    The Islamic Society of Northern Finland was registered in 2000, but Islamic activities began in the 90s. Our actions are a response to the call of Allah SWT(Subhanahu wata`ala): "and that you may become a congregation that calls people to goodness, guides them to the right way of life, and prevents them from evil" (Surah Al-Imran: verse 104).
    The goal of the organization is to please Allah (SWT) by striving to promote Islam, develop the Muslim community and benefit society. The organization always follows the Qur'an and the Sunnah (Prophets teaching), along with the Islamic Sharia, when making decisions and drawing up policies and procedures.

    We are based in Oulu, Northern Ostrobothnia, Finland.
